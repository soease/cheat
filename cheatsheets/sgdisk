# sgdisk
# Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator for Linux and Unix

# convert an MBR partition table to GPT, use sgdisk
sgdisk -g /dev/sda

# convert GPT to MBR use the m option.
# it is not possible to convert more than four partitions from GPT to MBR
sgdisk -m /dev/sda

# Sort GPT partitions
# when a new partition is created in the space between two partitions or a partition is deleted
sgdisk -s /dev/sda

# Using sgdisk you can create a binary backup consisting of the protective MBR,
# the main GPT header, the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table
sgdisk -b=sgdisk-sda.bak

# Restore GPT/MBR backup:
sgdisk -l=sgdisk-sda.bak

# Clone your current device's partition layout '/dev/sda' to another drive '/dev/sdc'
sgdisk -R=/dev/sdc /dev/sda

# If both drives will be in the same computer, you need to randomize the GUID's after cloning
sgdisk -G /dev/sdc
