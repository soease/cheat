# to recover a file in /home/SomeUserName/, assuming /home is on its own partition, run:
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-file SomeUserName/SomeDirectory

# Recover an entire directory
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-directory SomeUserName/SomeDirectory

# For advanced users, to manually recover blocks or inodes with extundelete,
# debugfs can be used to find the inode to be recovered;
# Additional inodes to recover can be listed in an unspaced, comma-separated fashion.
extundelete --restore-inode inode

# recover all deleted files from an entire partition
extundelete /dev/sda4 --restore-all
